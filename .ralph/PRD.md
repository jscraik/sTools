# PRD

## Overview

Close the remaining spec gaps for the Trustworthy Skills Inspector: ACIP scanning in remote installs,
multi-target rollback, signed changelog exports, telemetry schema allowlist, signed keyset refresh,
and verification event logging. Update specs and README to reflect the implemented behavior, and add
integration tests to cover end-to-end flows.

## Tasks

- This file is now a human-readable summary. The canonical tracker is `.ralph/prd.json`.

Remaining tasks (see `.ralph/prd.json` for IDs and acceptance criteria):
- Add CLI security/quarantine commands and tests.
- Expand integration tests for end-to-end workflows.
- Finalize docs and README updates for new CLI commands.
