# sTools PRD Bundle — 2026-01-22

This index links the three-stage product spec pipeline for sTools. No new content is introduced here.

## Documents
- Foundation Spec: `.spec/foundation-2026-01-22-stools.md`
- UX Spec: `.spec/ux-2026-01-22-stools.md`
- Build Plan: `.spec/build-plan-2026-01-22-stools.md`

## How to use
1) Read the Foundation Spec to confirm scope, success metrics, and the primary journey.
2) Use the UX Spec to implement UI/CLI behavior, states, and affordances.
3) Follow the Build Plan epics and stories; do not start implementation until acceptance criteria and tests are clear.
4) Treat Evidence Gaps as tasks to resolve before expanding scope.
