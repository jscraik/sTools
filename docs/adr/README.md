## ADR Process

ADRs follow the standard template with:
- **Status:** Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
- **Context:** Background and problem statement
- **Decision:** What was decided
- **Rationale:** Why this decision was made
- **Alternatives:** Options considered and why they were rejected
- **Tradeoffs:** What we gain and what we give up
- **Consequences:** Impact of this decision
- **Related Decisions:** Links to related ADRs

## Creating a New ADR

To propose a new architectural decision:

1. Copy the template from an existing ADR
2. Set status to "Proposed"
3. Present to stakeholders for review
4. Update status to "Accepted" once approved
