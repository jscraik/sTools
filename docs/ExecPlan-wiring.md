# sTools wiring and settings integration

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections `Progress`, `Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` must be kept up to date as work proceeds. Followed according to `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/plans.md`.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Enable users to: (a) trigger scan/sync/index from menu shortcuts in any mode, (b) pick and persist Codex/Claude skill roots via UI, and (c) index all Codex roots instead of only the first. Acceptance is observable through UI interactions and tests.

## Progress

- [x] (2026-01-10T00:00Z) Read standards and wiring notes; drafted ExecPlan.
- [x] (2026-01-10T17:45Z) Wired menu commands into SyncView and IndexView with cancel support.
- [x] (2026-01-10T17:55Z) Replaced sidebar roots with interactive pickers; added persistence and validation.
- [x] (2026-01-10T18:05Z) Shared recursive/exclude/maxDepth settings across modes via InspectorViewModel.
- [x] (2026-01-10T18:08Z) Extended SkillIndexer for multi-root Codex; updated IndexViewModel and tests.
- [x] (2026-01-10T18:10Z) Ran swift test (all pass, 1 skip expected for charts); updated retrospective pending.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- None yet.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Use UserDefaults to persist roots/settings to avoid new deps and keep offline behavior.  
  Rationale: Minimal surface change, aligns with existing local-only app.  
  Date/Author: 2026-01-10 / assistant.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

- Menu wiring, root management, shared settings, and multi-root index implemented; full `swift test` passing (one expected skip for charts). No open blockers observed.

## Context and Orientation

Key files: `Sources/SkillsInspector/App.swift` (menu commands), `ContentView.swift` (sidebar, mode navigation), `InspectorViewModel.swift` (shared state), `SyncView.swift`, `IndexView.swift`, `Sources/SkillsCore/Indexer.swift` (index generation), `Tests/SkillsInspectorTests` (existing coverage). Current issues: menu notifications only handled in `ValidateView`; roots hardcoded and not editable; recursive/exclude settings divergent; `SkillIndexer.generate` only accepts single Codex root.

## Plan of Work

1) Menu dispatch: add listeners in SyncView and IndexView (or shared dispatcher) for `.runScan`/`.cancelScan`/`.toggleWatch`/`.clearCache` where applicable, invoking view model actions with current settings and respecting cancellation.
2) Root management UI: replace static root list in sidebar with `RootRow` components for each Codex root plus Claude; add add/remove for Codex roots; reuse `validateRoot`; surface validation errors; persist roots/settings in shared model backed by UserDefaults (`UserSettings` struct).
3) Shared settings: move recursive/excludes/maxDepth to `InspectorViewModel`; pass bindings to Sync/Index views; remove local duplicates; centralize default excludes constant.
4) Multi-root indexing: extend `SkillIndexer.generate` to accept `[URL]` or add overload; update IndexViewModel to pass full array; merge results; ensure stable ordering; adjust index UI to display active roots state.
5) Tests and validation: add unit tests for multi-root index and settings persistence/validation; if UI coverage limited, add ViewModel-level tests for notification handling and UserDefaults serialization.

## Concrete Steps

1) Implement UserSettings persistence in `InspectorViewModel` with load/save on change (use `@Published` observers). Add shared `defaultExcludes`.
2) Update `ContentView` sidebar: iterate codexRoots with `RootRow`, add add/remove buttons, bind recursive/excludes/maxDepth inputs; ensure alert shows validation errors.
3) Update `SyncView` to accept bindings for settings and to listen to menu notifications; remove local state copies.
4) Update `IndexViewModel` to accept `[URL]`; update `IndexView` to use shared settings and add `.onReceive` for menu commands.
5) Modify `SkillsCore/Indexer.swift` with overload taking `[URL]` merging entries; keep legacy single-root API delegating.
6) Add tests in `Tests/SkillsInspectorTests` for multi-root index generation and settings persistence.
7) Run `swift test` (or subset) and record results.

## Validation and Acceptance

- Menu shortcuts (`⌘R`, `⌘.`) trigger sync/index when respective mode is active; observe operations start/stop.
- Roots can be added/removed and persist across relaunch (UserDefaults); invalid paths show alert and are not saved.
- Index includes entries from multiple Codex roots (e.g., two temp dirs with distinct skills yield combined list).
- `swift test` passes.

## Idempotence and Recovery

UserDefaults-backed settings are overwritten atomically on change; reloading app restores last saved settings. Notification handlers are guarded against invalid roots to avoid crashes. Operations cancel previous tasks before starting new ones.

## Artifacts and Notes

- None yet.

## Interfaces and Dependencies

- New/updated API: `SkillIndexer.generate(codexRoots: [URL], claudeRoot: URL?, include: IndexInclude, recursive: Bool, maxDepth: Int?, excludes: [String], excludeGlobs: [String]) -> [SkillIndexEntry]`; legacy single-root overload preserved.
