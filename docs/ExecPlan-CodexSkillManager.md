# Remote Skill Catalog & Import (CodexSkillManager parity for sTools)

This ExecPlan stays a living document. Keep the sections `Progress`,
`Surprises & Discoveries`, `Decision Log`, and `Outcomes & Retrospective` up to
date as work proceeds. Follow
`/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/plans.md` for required structure.

## Purpose / Big Picture

Deliver CodexSkillManager-matching capabilities inside sTools
(SkillsInspector + SkillsCore + skillsctl) so operators can browse Clawdhub,
search and filter remote skills, preview metadata/owners/changelogs,
download/install/update skills into Codex/Claude paths (or custom roots),
import local zips/folders, and render reference previews inline. The goal
remains a single app/CLI that manages both local and remote skill lifecycles
with evidence-backed operations (downloads, installs, publishes) and clear
status tags.

## Context and Orientation

Current repo (`sTools`) provides SkillsCore (scan/sync/index engine),
skillsctl CLI, and SkillsInspector macOS UI (run via `swift run SkillsInspector`).
Remote catalog features remain absent. Key entry points:

- CLI: `Sources/skillsctl/main.swift` (argument parsing, commands), shared

  utilities `Sources/skillsctl/FileWatcher.swift`.

- Core models/services: `Sources/SkillsCore/` (validation, cache, fix engine,

  indexing, export service).

- UI: `Sources/SkillsInspector/` (view models, views:

  `InspectorViewModel.swift`, `ValidateView.swift`, `SyncView.swift`,
  `StatsView.swift`, `FindingDetailView.swift`, etc.).

- Docs/schemas: `docs/` (config/baseline schemas).

Reference OSS repo: `Dimillian/CodexSkillManager` (SwiftPM macOS app) supplies
remote Clawdhub browsing, inline reference previews, import/export from
zip/folder, install target selection (Codex/Claude/custom), owner metadata,
and Sparkle packaging scripts. We'll port capabilities while aligning with
sTools architecture (SkillsCore as source of truth; SkillsInspector as shell;
skillsctl parity commands).

## Plan of Work

1) Gap analysis and design Perform side-by-side review of CodexSkillManager
features vs current sTools UI/CLI. Capture required data models (RemoteSkill,
RemoteSkillOwner, RemoteStats, InstallTarget) and flows (latest list, search,
detail fetch, version check, download, install, import zip/folder, delete,
tags). Decide on configuration surface (endpoints, cache sizes, default roots,
concurrency, telemetry fields). Document security/privacy (network calls to
clawdhub.com over HTTPS; avoid credential storage; redact logs).

2) Core remote client + data models (SkillsCore) Add `RemoteSkillClient`
(async) with URLSession + URLCache mirroring CodexSkillManager (10MB
memory/50MB disk) and pure functions for
fetchLatest/search/fetchDetail/fetchLatestVersion/download. Define DTOs and
domain models (`RemoteSkill`, `RemoteSkillOwner`, `RemoteSkillDownload`,
`RemoteSkillInstallResult`). Add error taxonomy (network, decode, validation,
install conflict, checksum) with user-facing messages. Add download/install
pipeline that unzips to temp, validates SKILL.md via existing validator, and
copies into selected root with rollback on failure. Include SHA256
verification where possible and preserve file permissions. Provide dependency
injection hooks for testing and offline.

3) CLI surface Extend `skillsctl` with `remote` command group: `list`
(latest), `search <query>`, `detail <slug>`, `download <slug> [--version
<v>]`, `install <slug> [--version <v>] [--target codex|claude|path]`, `update
<slug>` (checks latest version vs installed). Support JSON/text output, exit
codes, cache toggle, and concurrency flags. Add telemetry output (duration,
bytes downloaded, cache hits). Ensure commands reuse SkillsCore client and
install pipeline. Update completion scripts and help texts.

4) SkillsInspector UI/UX Add Remote tab alongside Check/Sync/Index.
Components: remote list (latest), search bar, filters (installed/updates
available), detail panel with owner info, changelog, stats, tags (Codex/Claude
installed), version picker, download/install buttons, open in Finder, delete.
Integrate status badges matching CodexSkillManager TagView semantics. Add
inline reference previews to existing detail view using Markdown rendering
plus collapsible reference list (like CodexSkillManager
ReferenceDetailInlineView/ReferenceListView). Provide import dialogs for
folder/zip and install target selection, with progress HUD and error toasts.
Add caching indicator and manual refresh.

5) Import/export parity Build `ImportSkillView`-matching flows in
SkillsInspector: pick folder/zip, check contents, choose target roots,
handle conflicts (prompt overwrite/rename/skip), and show summary. Add CLI
counterparts (proposed `skillsctl import --path <zip|dir> --target ...`). Add
export/share action from detail to zip. Reuse `ExportService` where possible;
extend with zipping and target selection.

6) Remote detail cache + update detection Add `RemoteSkillDetailCache`-like
store in SkillsCore to cache owners/changelogs with TTL (configurable). Expose
update availability by comparing installed version (from SKILL.md frontmatter
or metadata) with `fetchLatestVersion`. Surface update badges in UI and
proposed `skillsctl remote list --with-updates` (not yet implemented).

7) Packaging/update channel decision Assess need for Sparkle update flow. If
we keep Sparkle, align Scripts/ signing instructions (reuse existing
`Scripts/` in CodexSkillManager). Otherwise, add in-app update notification
(link to release page). Document in README and app About view.

8) Testing and telemetry Add unit tests for RemoteSkillClient (mock
URLProtocol), installer (temp dir, conflict cases), and CLI commands (argument
parsing, JSON output). Add UI snapshot/unit tests for Remote tab view models
(no network). Extend telemetry to include network metrics (bytes, latency,
cache hits). Ensure tests avoid real network (use DI).

9) Documentation and governance Update README (SkillsInspector app section)
and docs
(config schema additions for remote endpoints/cache/targets). Add architecture
note describing remote data flow and security posture (no auth, HTTPS only,
caching, redaction). Ensure AGENTS.md and CODESTYLE compliance (no hard-coded
secrets, deterministic tests).

10) Validation and rollout Manual QA: `swift test`, `swift run skillsctl
remote list --format json`, `swift run skillsctl remote install
<slug> --target codex --allow-empty` in a sandbox directory, and UI manual run
of Remote tab. Capture before/after evidence. Prepare migration notes (new
config keys) and feature flag toggles if needed.

## Concrete Steps

- Working dir: repository root `/Users/jamiecraik/dev/sTools`.
- Analysis: compare CodexSkillManager sources in `/tmp/CodexSkillManager`

  (RemoteSkillClient/ImportSkillView/etc.) and map into
  SkillsCore/SkillsInspector/skillsctl design.

- Build core client/models/tests in `Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/` (new

  folder) and wiring in existing services.

- Wire CLI subcommands in `Sources/skillsctl/main.swift` with shared option

  parsing helpers; update completions.

- Add UI files under `Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/` for views, view models,

  and caches; integrate into `ContentView.swift` navigation and `DesignTokens`
  for badges.

- Extend Export/Import services in `Sources/SkillsInspector/` and

  `Sources/SkillsCore/ExportService.swift` for zip support.

- Update docs: `README.md`, `docs/config-schema.json`,

  `docs/baseline-schema.json` (if needed), add usage examples in `docs/`.

- Commands to run during implementation/validation:
  - `swift test`
  - `swift run skillsctl remote list --format json`
  - `swift run SkillsInspector` (manual QA of Remote tab)
  - Optional (after import lands): `swift run skillsctl import --help`,
    `swift run skillsctl remote install --help`

## Validation and Acceptance

Change qualifies as acceptable when:

- All tests pass (`swift test`).
- `skillsctl remote list/search/detail/install/update/import` work with mock

  server or sample slug, returning structured JSON/text with correct exit
  codes.

- SkillsInspector Remote tab displays latest skills, search results, owner

  metadata, tags for installed/updates, and allows install/import/export with
  visible progress and error handling.

- Inline reference previews render within skill detail with collapsible

  sections.

- Update detection highlights newer versions when available.
- Documentation reflects new commands/config/options and security

  considerations.

## Idempotence and Recovery

Remote operations must stay retryable: downloads write to temp dir then move
atomically; installs check and rollback on failure; caches clear from UI/CLI;
repeated imports skip/rename on conflict. CLI commands should stay safe to
rerun. Provide `--dry-run` where practical.

## Artifacts and Notes

- New source files under `Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/`,

  `Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/`, CLI command additions, and tests.

- Updated docs and schemas capturing remote configuration and usage.
- Evidence: test output, sample JSON from `skillsctl remote list`, screenshots

  of Remote tab (store in `.ios-web/` or temp, not committed unless
  requested).

## Interfaces and Dependencies

- New dependency: none beyond Foundation/SwiftUI; reuse existing Markdown
  renderer. If HTTP image loading becomes necessary, use `AsyncImage` with
  caching or a lightweight loader; avoid third-party additions unless
  justified.

- RemoteSkillClient interface: fetchLatest(limit:Int) async throws ->

  [RemoteSkill] search(query:String, limit:Int) async throws -> [RemoteSkill]
  fetchDetail(slug:String) async throws -> RemoteSkillOwner?
  fetchLatestVersion(slug:String) async throws -> String?
  download(slug:String, version:String?) async throws -> URL

- Installer interface: install(from url: URL, target: SkillInstallTarget,

  overwrite: Bool) async throws -> RemoteSkillInstallResult

- CLI contract: `skillsctl remote <subcommand>` with JSON/text output schemas

  documented.
