# Trustworthy Skills Inspector Improvements (verification, UX, cross-IDE installs)

This ExecPlan is a living document. The sections Progress, Surprises & Discoveries, Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective must be kept up to date as work proceeds. This plan follows /Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/plans.md and is additive to docs/PLANS.md.

## Purpose / Big Picture

After this change, users can preview remote skills safely, verify them before install, and install once across Codex, Claude Code, and Copilot with clear provenance signals. The UI makes the source context obvious (local vs remote), shows a detail preview panel with signer and changelog information, and provides bulk actions for verification and updates. The CLI gains explicit preview and verification commands that match the UI flow. A user can verify success by installing a remote skill and seeing a verified badge, a ledger entry, and a successful cross-IDE install result.

- [ ] (2026-01-16) Run validation: swift test (targeted + full), UI snapshot checks, and CLI smoke commands.

## Surprises & Discoveries

- Observation: Remote ZIPs often contain only a single skill directory and SKILL.md, but some archives include additional files; this makes file-count enforcement critical to avoid zip-bomb abuse.
  Evidence: RemoteSkillInstallerTests failures during limit enforcement.
- Observation: swift test --filter RemoteSkillClientTests terminated with a fatalError during build/link.
  Evidence: Build output ended with "error: fatalError" while linking skillsctl-tool.
- Observation: Tests still fail when using a custom build path because SwiftPM cannot download Sparkle's SPM zip (GitHub release asset).
  Evidence: swift test --disable-sandbox --build-path .build-codex ended with NSURLErrorDomain -1 while fetching Sparkle-for-Swift-Package-Manager.zip.
- Observation: Even with a local Sparkle override, SwiftPM cannot write output-file-map.json (skillsctl-tool.build) and fails with NSCocoaErrorDomain 513.
  Evidence: swift test --disable-sandbox --build-path /tmp/stools-build2 returned permission error for output-file-map.json.

## Decision Log

- Decision: Use a hexagonal architecture with ports/adapters so verification and policy logic are isolated from UI/CLI/network.
  Rationale: Keeps integrity logic testable and swapable for future sources.
  Date/Author: 2026-01-12 / Codex
- Decision: Standardize the ledger on SQLite (not JSONL) to support queryable history, changelog generation, and rollbacks.
  Rationale: Queryability and integrity constraints outweigh flat-file simplicity.
  Date/Author: 2026-01-12 / Codex
- Decision: Adopt split-view navigation and a detail preview panel based on CodexSkillManager to reduce user confusion and increase trust context.
  Rationale: Proven UX pattern observed in recon and aligns with consent-based preview.
  Date/Author: 2026-01-12 / Codex
- Decision: Treat preview cache as potentially hostile and validate cached preview against manifest hash/ETag.
  Rationale: Prevent cache poisoning and stale metadata from bypassing consent.
  Date/Author: 2026-01-12 / Codex
- Decision: Use a local Sparkle binary override (LocalSparkle) to avoid dependency fetch failures during tests.
  Rationale: GitHub release asset downloads fail in this environment; local binary allows SwiftPM to resolve without network.

## Outcomes & Retrospective

- (2026-01-13) Ledger-backed changelog generation is now available in the UI, with SQLite-backed event storage and a basic ledger history panel. Remote installs now emit ledger entries for successful and failed installs.
- (2026-01-13) skillsctl remote now supports preview, verify, and install/update flows with structured JSON errors and schema-validated outputs.
- (2026-01-13) Publish pipeline now builds deterministic zip artifacts, signs attestation with an Ed25519 key, and enforces tool hash pinning before running the publisher.
- (2026-01-16) Remote installs now enforce ACIP scanning, MIME checks, and all-or-nothing rollback across targets. Changelog exports are signed with a per-device key, telemetry is schema-sanitized, and trust stores can refresh from a signed remote keyset when configured.

## Context and Orientation

Repository root is /Users/jamiecraik/dev/sTools. The core domain logic is in Sources/SkillsCore, the macOS UI is in Sources/SkillsInspector, and the CLI is in Sources/skillsctl. Remote installation logic currently lives in Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/RemoteSkillInstaller.swift. The remote catalog client is Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/RemoteSkillClient.swift. The UI remote list is Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/RemoteView.swift and its view model is Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/RemoteViewModel.swift. Skills are installed into ~/.codex/skills, ~/.claude/skills, and ~/.copilot/skills.

Split-view navigation means a two-column layout where the left column lists skills and the right column shows a detail preview. A detail preview panel means the right column shows SKILL.md, changelog, signer, and verification status without downloading or unzipping the full archive. A bulk toolbar action is a top-level control that operates on multiple skills (for example, Verify All or Update All Verified).

## Plan of Work

Start by extending the remote data flow so the UI can request and cache preview metadata. In Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/RemoteSkillClient.swift, add a fetchManifest and fetchPreview method that retrieves the manifest and a safe SKILL.md preview (via HEAD/Range). Add a small cache in SkillsCore to store preview content and changelog snippets keyed by slug/version. Wire that into Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/RemoteViewModel.swift to keep preview state and provenance badges.

Update the UI in Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/RemoteView.swift and ContentView.swift to move to a split-view layout: list on the left, detail preview on the right. Add a toolbar with bulk actions (Verify All, Update All Verified, Export Changelog). The detail preview should show signer status, manifest hash, changelog, and a button to Download and Verify. Ensure the button is disabled if the preview is unverified or the manifest is missing.

Introduce TrustStore persistence. Add a simple local JSON file at ~/Library/Application Support/SkillsInspector/trust.json, and create a small view model (new file Sources/SkillsInspector/TrustStoreViewModel.swift) to read/write allowlisted keys. Add a consent prompt when a new signer is seen, and surface revocation status in the detail panel.

Extend the installer path to support cross-IDE adapter installs. Add an adapter layer in SkillsCore (new folder Sources/SkillsCore/Adapters) that takes the validated skill directory and copies it to Codex, Claude, and Copilot roots with per-target validation. Record per-target results in the ledger.

Add the SQLite ledger and changelog generator under Sources/SkillsCore/Ledger. Emit ledger events on install, update, and removal. Update the UI ChangelogView to read from the ledger and export markdown.

Extend skillsctl in Sources/skillsctl/main.swift with preview/verify/install subcommands and JSON errors that include error codes, messages, and request IDs. Ensure CLI output matches existing schema validation patterns in docs/schema.

Close remaining gap items by wiring ACIP scanning into the remote install flow (quarantine/block), enforcing MIME checks on archives, switching multi-target installs to rollback on partial failures, and signing changelog exports with a per-device key stored in Keychain. Add a signed keyset fetch endpoint in the remote client and refresh the local trust store only when the keyset signature verifies against a pinned root key. Record ledger verify events during bulk verification and add integration tests that exercise ACIP quarantine, changelog signing, and keyset verification.

## Concrete Steps

Work from /Users/jamiecraik/dev/sTools. Use rg to find definitions and add new files in the directories noted above. Suggested commands and expected outcomes follow.

    rg "RemoteView" Sources/SkillsInspector
    rg "RemoteSkillClient" Sources/SkillsCore/Remote

After implementing preview and cache changes, run:

    swift test --filter RemoteSkillInstallerTests

After implementing UI and ledger changes, run:

    swift test

Optional CLI smoke checks:

    swift run skillsctl remote --help
    swift run skillsctl remote install --help

## Validation and Acceptance

The work is acceptable when all of the following can be verified:

- The UI shows a split-view layout with a detail preview panel for remote skills.
- Clicking a remote skill shows SKILL.md preview, changelog, signer provenance, and a Download and Verify button.
- A verified install shows a Verified badge and the ledger records per-target results for Codex, Claude, and Copilot.
- Running swift test passes, and the targeted RemoteSkillInstallerTests pass.
- The CLI exposes preview and verify commands and returns JSON errors when verification fails.

## Idempotence and Recovery

All steps are additive. Re-running installs should be idempotent by archive hash and target set. If a preview or install fails, no changes should persist outside the staging directory. If the TrustStore file is corrupted, delete it and recreate it; the UI must prompt for signer trust again.

## Artifacts and Notes

Key files to be added or updated:

    Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/RemoteSkillClient.swift
    Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/RemoteSkillInstaller.swift
    Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/RemoteArtifactSecurity.swift
    Sources/SkillsCore/Adapters/
    Sources/SkillsCore/Ledger/
    Sources/SkillsCore/Remote/RemotePreviewCache.swift
    Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/RemoteView.swift
    Sources/SkillsInspector/Remote/RemoteViewModel.swift
    Sources/SkillsInspector/TrustStoreViewModel.swift
    Sources/skillsctl/main.swift
    docs/schema/ (new JSON schemas for preview/verify outputs)

## Interfaces and Dependencies

- RemoteCatalogPort (Swift protocol): fetchLatest, search, fetchManifest, fetchPreview, download.
- VerificationPort: verify(archiveURL, manifest, policy, trustStore) -> outcome.
- InstallerPort: install(archiveURL, targets) -> per-target results.
- LedgerPort: append/query for audit and changelog.
- PublishPort: build+attest using pinned tool clawdhub@0.1.0 with integrity hash.

All new logic stays in SkillsCore and is surfaced via SkillsInspector UI and skillsctl CLI. No new third-party dependencies are required for the initial milestones.
